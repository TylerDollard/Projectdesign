## General Resume Guidelines
if you have a lot of content on your resume, you can change the margins of the page to fit more text. 

Bold your names (Times new roman, 16pt, uppercase )

Do not do anything smaller than 11 point font 

Make sure your content is clear and concise

You can categorize any kind of experience that you have. Whether it be your education, school projects, volunteer 
work, internship. 

You should craft your resumes unique to each job you apply to. Utilization of career-specific buzzwords.

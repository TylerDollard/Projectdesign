# Network Analysis Exercise 1: Preparation

What's a network analysis? It's a way of studying how data about people/places/items/characters (anything you're tracking) is related by shared properties or contexts. For example, on this page scroll to see [a network analysis plotted from blues lyrics data based on shared decades](https://am0eba-byte.github.io/blues/index.html)

For this intro orientation, we're working with code from the DIGIT 400 Smash Tiers project, to create a network analysis of information about Mario Brothers' characters, the games they appear in and the tiers they share. We'll be working with Cytoscape software to plot the graph. 

## Cytoscape 
You can work with Cytoscape in the DIGIT computer lab classrooms (in Kochel 77, Witkowski 109, and in Lilley library). You can download and install it
